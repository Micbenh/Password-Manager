# Password Manager and Generator 
This is the code repo for my Password Manager and Generator.<br>
until now it contains the following functionalities:<br>

* <b>Adding a New Password</b>:  After choosing this option, the program will prompt the user to enter the Relevant username, Password and Service that he is signing up to.

* <b> List all Passwords</b>: There isnt alot to add, the program will list all the Users, passwords and services that user has signed up to. 

* <b>search for a password by site</b>: The program will ask the user for the name of the service and will show him all the relevant users and passwords for that service.

*  <b>search for a password by user</b>: The program will ask the user for the username he is looking for and will show him all the relevant users, passwords and services that he signed up to with that username

*   <b>Delete password</b>: The program will list the relevant users and the user will choose which entry he wants to delete


## Features that i will add soon (not in  a special order):
1) <b> Update Entry</b>: An option to update a user's password in case the password has been updated

2) <b> Bulk delete passwords</b>: An option that will allow the user to delete <b>ALL</b> entries in case he wants to delete the software and the information that has been saved 

3) <b>Generate Password</b>: After the user will choose to add a password, instead of only asking him to choose a passowrd to enter, a new option will be added that will generate a random password for security reasons.
